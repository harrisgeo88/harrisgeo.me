I recently came across a bug which required to dive deep into how SQS queues process messages before they get sent to DLQs. At first the whole idea of fallback seemed straightforward but after analysing our setup with my team, we came across some interesting insights about SQS which I would like to share with you today.

SQS is an AWS service that allows us to create and manage queues in a really simple way (that’s why it’s called **S**imple **Q**ueue **S**ervice). As a redrive policy, AWS recommends us to connect queues to other special queues designed to receive faulty messages. Such queues are called **D**ead **L**etter **Q**ueues.

SQS provides us with a plenty of options on how to fallback. Let’s explore the idea behind them and how to use them efficiently with AWS Lambda functions.

## How does a message end up in a DLQ

When Lambda functions process SQS messages, they call the `ReceiveMessage` API on SQS. This processing can either be successful or fail. If our function attempts to consume a message more than **x** times unsuccessfully, it gets marked as faulty and is sent to the DLQ. Then, this message will be available to us for further investigation to find out what went wrong.

The default settings when adding a redrive policy give us 2 retries. In other words, our consumer will pull the message from SQS and attempt to execute **3 times** in total. If it fails all 3 times, then that message gets sent to the DLQ.

Now we might be asking ourselves.What is the service that decides on how these retries are handled? Is it Lambda or SQS? Well, technically both... To explain that, let us dive a bit deeper into the idea of max receive counts, visibility timeouts and messages in flight.

## Max receive counts

Earlier we talked about 2 retries or 3 attempts it total. That is what the `maxReceiveCount` property is all about (or maximum receives on the UI). We can configure it when setting up the queue.

</p>

Once a message is sent to a SQS queue, the Lambda function that is listening to that queue will receive a signal that a new message is ready to be consumed. Then, Lambda will pull that message and attempt to process it. Every time Lambda pulls a message from the queue, SQS gives a + 1 to its count value. If you have ever polled messages on the AWS console, you would have seen the `receive count` property. That’s where we see how many times each message has been pulled.

🚨 Friendly advice, be careful not to poll messages in queues that have redrive mechanisms, as you might raise a few alarms that will wake up the poor engineer who is currently on call :)

</p>

In case all 3 attempts were unsuccessful, then SQS will use its redrive policy and send the message to the DLQ. That essentially means the **receive count** has reached the **maximum receive count** we have set.

Now here’s the question. How exactly does SQS understand what happens to a message after it is being pulled? Will Lambda send some sort of signal that processing is done? Actually, SQS has a special way of treating messages that are currently being processed.

## Visibility timeouts and messages in flight

Another important option when setting up our SQS queue is the `visibilityTimeout`. That is measured in **seconds** and is the amount of time SQS gives the Lambda to process each message or batch of messages.

Once a message is pulled from the queue, that message will be put in `message in flight`. As you might have already guessed, this mode lasts for the amount of seconds specified in the **visibility timeout**.

Now, we put pressure to the Lambda as it needs to finish the entire execution within the visibility time given. If Lambda succeeds, it calls the `DeleteMessage` API on SQS which removes that message from the queue.

If the execution fails, the Lambda leaves the message where it was in the queue, the visibility period times out and the message is being put back into the queue with **message available** status.

For that, we need to have an idea of how long the Lambda take to process that message because it might introduce a side effect where the visibility timeout is 30 seconds and the Lambda took 45 to execute. If that happens, the message will be processed by the Lambda twice as the message will become again available and will be pulled by the next round of processing by the Lambda.

For that reason it is recommended for the visibility timeout to be greater than the time it takes for our application to either execute or time out. That way we eliminate the edge case where the application takes longer to execute than the message being in flight.

## To sum up

The idea behind queues is simple. However, there might be certain issues which require a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms in SQS so that we can solve them. Next time we will dive into FIFO queues which have some interesting problems they can solve.
