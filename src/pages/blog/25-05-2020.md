We can all agree that "_it works on my machine_" is a really popular term in the modern software development world. It is quite annoying trying to open a pull request on Github (assuming you have some checks in place) and then see that your deployment failed. It is even more annoying to see that your code failed due to something that in your head falls under the category of "_devops are the ones who need to deal with it_".

The truth is that growing as a developer does not necessarily mean you should not care about things that are not directly related to you. It is common to hear "_I am a Frontend developer, why would I care about docker_". In my opinion understanding the big picture no matter how directly related that is to what you do will not in any case cause any harm.

I recently got involved in a new project inside [Equals](https://equalsmoney.com) that taught me some great stuff about dealing with such issues and I would like to share these learnings with you. Being more involved in the ops side of things gave me the opportunity to dive a bit deeper into how to use docker "correctly". The whole idea of docker is to develop software in a flexible way that allows our applications to go through the different stages of our deployment pipeline with ease. It is common to see approaches that sacrifice how clean the code is in order to handle all these scenarios of where our code is hosted. However because this is a biiig topic which touches several different parts of our code I am going to split that into several different blog posts. Today I am going to talk about environment variables.

### The problem

Managing multiple environments and their configs can be quite simple for small projects but it gets wild upon scaling. Weekend projects and other small apps may have a couple if any config variables. However projects managed by big teams may require a lot more, especially the ones that have multiple stages before reaching production. In many cases the easy solution is to hardcode every different stage inside the code. That usually looks like that.

```js
...
ourApi: {
	local: 'http://localhost:1234/api',
	develop: 'http://develop.example.com/api',
	staging: 'http://staging.example.com/api',
	production: 'https://example.com/api'
}
...
```

The issues usually begin when there is a last minute change of the production URL which by the way happens a lot more often than I thought. We have to add a new commit just to change the environment URL. Then we have to open a pull request and tell our team to quickly approve it and god forbid someone requests for changes, the Github comments on the PR will turn into war zone. We then wait for it to be deployed to all N stages of our pipeline, wish that the CI is not going to fail this time. I hope you do not have these days as well where you do spend a few hours waiting for the CI to turn green. Wait there's more! While waiting for this to go through, the database team noticed a malicious act. They have to change the password of the user that is connected to the database. Awesome! We have to go through the same process again.

How about APIs, headless cms and other keys and sensitive info? We wouldn't dare store them into a config file like that right? **RIGHT!?!?!** Oh dear, no... Let's all be honest, we've been there before. However we are here to talk about how to not go through a tough time when the boss realises that this may be related to a recent cyber attack the company faced (runs away). First thing we do is to identify exactly what we are doing wrong. For example if our code does that kind of stuff.

```js
if (window.location.href === api.production) {
  // execute prod code
} else if (window.location.href === api.staging) {
  // execute staging environment code
} else {
  // execute local? what if there was also a QA env? another else if? LMFAO
}
```

or that ðŸ™„

```js
// some config file
...
env: process.env.STAGE || 'develop'
...
```

or even that ðŸ˜ª

```js
const productionEnv = 'http://example.com'
const clientRequest = await axios.get(`${productionEnv}/clients`)
...
```

Yep all of these are approaches are bad and [forget about it](https://media1.tenor.com/images/1b5bb2802d4c90a6ba4e01fa6b359342/tenor.gif?itemid=13116595). I dare you to show that piece of code to your devops colleagues to see how long it takes before they start talking to you in French. Is that the best we can do as developers? It is not acceptable to hardcode stuff like that. We all need to get used to the idea of writing apps that are environment agnostic. What that means is that all the required environment-related information should be passed to the app upon deployment. Each environment will have its own unique configuration files that will tell the app what URLs to request from etc. There are a few ways of doing that but today we will talk about environment variables.

Environment variables are going to become our best friend. They are these weird all-capital letter variables we put before running our node commands. You have definitely seen stuff like that `NODE_ENV=production node server.js` Env variables are used to inject information and can be read from anywhere within your app. As you can imagine they are really popular in the devops world. It is common to see names like `STAGE`, `NODE_ENV` or `PORT` or anything you may need.

Certain env variables are strict about what they do.`NODE_ENV` is a good example which is used for specifying if your application is running in **development** or **production** mode. **Development** refers to running your code locally or in a environment designed for development purposes. It enables features like hot reloading, debugging and more. **Production** mode on the other hand is the opposite which makes our apps lighter. That is ideal when many users visit our websites. There is obviously a lot more to it so let's not shift away from our current topic. Getting deeper into such modes is a blog-post on its own
.

It is common to see `NODE_ENV` taking more values depending on the stage or environment we are at. This can cause confusion as some libraries only disable certain development features only when the value of that is **production**. That would be quite bad for environments like staging which should be identical to production but because of that "small" difference they are not. This is why I personally like adding another level of abstraction so that we avoid such issues.

`ENV` or often defined as `STAGE` stands for the name of your actual environment or stage. It can take values like `develop`, `staging`, `qa`, you name it. This also makes it easier when we look at config files as it instantly describes which environment is that. However, do not use it to look up environment URLs like we did in our first example as this is a bad practice.

Following the same logic we can add env variables for anything we want. Environment variables are a straightforward concept which for some weird reason causes lots of confusion. I hope this blog post helped you understand this concept better. In the next parts of these series we are going to talk about `docker`, `dotenv` files and more. The examples used in this post are completely finctional and exaggerated with the purpose to help you better understand the problem.
